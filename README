ARCHER
======

archer is my personal additions to the standard library. as i learn
common lisp, i imagine this will change drastically and i think it
will be interesting to see how this evolves.


FAST INSTALL
============

1. git clone https://github.com/kisom/cl-archer.git ~/.archer
2. add the following to your ~/.sbclrc or ~/.cmucl-init.lisp
    ;;; load the archer library
    (let ((archer-init (merge-pathnames ".archer/init.lisp"
                                        (user-homedir-pathname))))
       (when (probe-file archer-init)
         (format t "loaded archer~%")
         (load archer-init)))
3. fire up sbcl or cmucl!

i haven't tried this on any other implementations.
